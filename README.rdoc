= Redmine Escalations Plugin

This plugin simply emails all users of a role titled 'Support' when an issue in the 'Support' tracker has been opened and un-actioned for 2hrs. It adds a tab with a list of escalated issues to each project page.

= TODO
* Need to add a settings page to administer the escalation time and the user role to email
* Need to group by id when selecting issues to display so there are no duplicates
